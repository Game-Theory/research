# Nash Equilibrium

## 2.1 - Strategic Games
- Strategic games
  - Every player simultaniously choses their sole plan of action.
  - N = players; i = player; A_i = set of actions with preferences (action, preference);  
  - Players have to have actions (can't have random unneeded players)
  - The preference function of each action **is dependent on the other player's actions**
    - ie. if I choose rock, I will have 1 preference defined for if you choose paper vs if you choose scissor.
