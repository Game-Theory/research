*NOTE: We spent a lot of time figuring out how the book defines a Bayesian Game. Once we finished we only had a little
time to review section 3.1.*

### 3.1
- Pure strategy: Only one action is chosen with positive probability
- Mixed strategy: Players introduce an element of randomness to their strategy, they can choose multiple actions and give them postiive probability
- Section 3.2.3 describes how you can actually represent mixed strategy nash equilibrium as pure strategies
