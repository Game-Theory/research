## Notes
These notes are by no means complete or even totally factual. Just stuff I jotted down when talking. It would be useful to have better notes & definitions. I'll come back to this when solving my exercise.

### 2.4 - Existence of a Nash Equilibrium
- You can prove that there must exist a Nash equilibrium if the game conforms to specific properties
- if every action profile is a convex set
- compact set: contains itâ€™s limits points and it is bounded
- this is considering infinity actions

- some proofs prove that there is *only* one nash equilibrium

### 2.5 - Strictly Competitive Games
- maxminimizerâ€” maxing your profit, minimizing their profit
- in a strictly competitive game, all actors will be maxminimizers
- Can be used to reason about properties of games if we know they are strictly competitive--super useful stuff!

### 2.6 - Bayesian Games ðŸŽ‰
- [Good video on Bayesian Games (mentions player types)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzN-eV_Na10)
- [?] omega is [a set of...?...] which will influence player's strategies
- each player has a sense for other players choice depending on an external source of randomness
- [?] each player uses information coming from signals to deduce the probability that a specific result of omega has occurred
- if signal function has all the info, it is a complete view [is this called complete view?]
