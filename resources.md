# General Game Theory
-	[Game Theory: An Introduction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byw_CYbPDsDEal9WNGJiTVdHODg/view?usp=sharing)
  - [kf] A solid game theory text book suggested by @kidwai :)
  - [mk] 
  	* I've updated the link to the 2nd edition, in which the problems aren't omitted. This was my only concern prior with this book.
  	* [Here](#https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/faculty/science/math-stats/syllabi/MATH%203400%20-%20Fall%20term.pdf) is the syllabus for the course I used this in.
  	* Pros: 
  		* well-written, with sensible notation and uniformity across definitions, theorems, proofs
  		* replaces extensive linear programming background with maple commands
  		* lots of examples and pictures 
  		* only 100 pages - good to get an introduction to major aspects of the theory prior focusing explicitly on a specific topic (although if a more focused book were to contained a self-contained primer that could also be useful)



# Cooperative Game Theory
- [Applied Cooperative Game Theory](http://www.wifa.uni-leipzig.de/fileadmin/user_upload/itvwl-vwl/MIKRO/Lehre/CGT-applications/acgt_2010_07_09.pdf)

# Social Choice Theory
- [Introduction to Computational Social Choice](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/introCOMSOCBOOK15.pdf)

# Game Theory and Network Dynamics
- [Networks, Crowds, Markets](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book.pdf)
 - [mk]
 	* I've read parts of this. It's a bit wordy, but provides good intuition for modelling networks as games on graphs. Useful for people with minimal Economics background interested in killing two birds with one stone. Not necessary if aggregate network behaviour is not of interest. 



# Papers 

- [Blockchain Mining Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02420v1.pdf)
	- [mk] This recent paper introduces a model of Bitcoin mining as a stochastic game. There isn't a lot of work in this area yet, so I had planned to look into this some more.
