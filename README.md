# Research
This repository should act as a hub for research into game theory and it's applications
in the blockchain space, particularly Ethereum.

Currently we are going through the book [*A Course in Game Theory*](http://icds.gzu.edu.cn/studyFiles/2014010721511410737.pdf)
and notes on each chapter will be posted here.
